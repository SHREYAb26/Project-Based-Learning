Traffic jams at road crossings is a major issue in a populous country like India. During
emergency situations this becomes a major obstacle, which needs to be resolved in
order to save a lot of lives especially in case of medical emergencies.
After analysis of these research papers, along with
some corrections and new ideas, solutions and models were proposed.
Out of which, one solution which was thought to be best suited, that
included RFID tag and reader, was selected. Components along with specifications
were listed and costing estimated. Based on infrastructure and location of traffic
junction this solution was further classified into 3 types: Overbridge sensor, sideways
sensor and on road sensor. These were again studied and limitations were noted of each
type.
RFID being placed on each vehicle (special tags for emergency vehicles like
Ambulance) are detected by RFID reader. Back-end algorithms were studied and listed
which will manage traffic light duration after acquiring live vehicle-congestion data
from microcontroller interfaced with RFID reader.
This model aims for a revolutionary change in tackling medical emergencies if this
model is implemented perfectly. Although some of the limitations viz. additional
infrastructure, installing RFID tags on each vehicle, additional maintenance cost needs
to be resolved for this to be implemented in crowded cities of India.
